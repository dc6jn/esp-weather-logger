# esp-weather-logger

A manual fork from https://github.com/gmag11/FSBrowserNG and  https://github.com/species5618/MQTT_ESP8266

added support for bme280 sensors and improved data logging 

For a overview of implemented features please refer to the original work, it makes no sense to byte-copy a good dokumentation ;)

#Changes

##removals
I removed support for IO to some degree

##additions
I added support for bme280 sensors.

Main goal of this fork was to implement data storage for past measurements.
